# quaesitor-cli
A node-based commandâ€“line interface for quaesitor.

Quaesitor locates Latin scientific names in Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish text (approximately 96% of biodiversity titles). It uses a combination of pattern matching (regular expressions) and a trio of complementary ensembled neural networks. A [live version](https://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/dlittle/quaesitor.html) of the web interface is hosted at the New York Botanical Garden.
